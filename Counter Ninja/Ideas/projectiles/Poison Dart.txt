Poison Dart

Effect:
This projectile does no damage. Instead, when it hits an enemy, it stuns
the enemy for X seconds. While stunned, the afflicted enemy cannot throw projectiles, attck, 
move, turn, or teleport for the duration of the stun. However, taking damage while stunned
instantly breaks the stun. If it does not hit an enemy, then it does nothing, similar to how
a regular kunai does nothing if it does not hit an enemy.

Physics/How is throws:
This projectile acts and throws in the same way that the regular kunai does. You throw it,
it hits, it stuns. Nothing too complicated.

Appearance:
I have no idea. Maybe it can look like on of those darts you throw at a dart board? Suggestions needed

Enemy usage:
We'll propably need another palate swapped ninja so that we can have an enemy use this. Dart throwing
ninjas will probably be a support type enemy. We'll also need an ammo refill bag for this. I'm not sure about a
kitsune throwing darts, since that would just be too annoying.
