Looks:

	He is an ashigaru (basic japanese foot soldier) that is weilding a spear. He wears a conical asian straw hat on hjis head. on his feet, he wears japanese style sandals
	with socks and a cloth belt. He wears shin guards, arm guards, and bracers. He also wears a japanese-style scale curiass that covers his midsection and his hip area. The
	bottom of the curiass opens up in a skirt-like fashion. Under all the armor, the Ashigaru wears a cloth long sleeve shirt and cloth pants. He always holds his spear out in front
	of him so that he hits players that run into him from the front. The type of spear that the Ashigaru uses is a Yari, which looks like a long pole with a strait blade attached to the end.

Behavior:
	He walks in a set path back and forth until he hits a wall. When he hits a wall, he turn around until he hits another wall, dies, or reaches the end of his preset path.
	 He moves at a speed that is slower than the player and the chargins boss. He damages the player by coming into contact with the player with his front side, since he sticks 
	out the pointy part of his spear in front of him.. he can be damaged by getting hit by a projectile from the front or the back. He can also be damaged by spikes
	and other level hazards.When he dies, he dies in a puff of smoke, similar to the basic ninja enemy. He does not follow the player around because he follows a set path.
